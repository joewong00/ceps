      <h1 style="color: white;">Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        Plans are already a foot to venture aggressively into the local and export markets through our participation in international trade fairs and exibihitions. This is in line with our government's call and encouragement to promote our Made-In-Malaysia products overseas. Our immediate task is to capture a sizeable share of the Asian Market followed by the Middle East Countries. If opportunities are extant, we may even target at the European Market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company's long term vision is to achieve standards certification from ISO and see the name 'CEPS' as one of the leading brand names in the global food service industry.
